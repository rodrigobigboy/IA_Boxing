Health and stamina values are unique for each fighter.

Speed affects probability of landing and defending a punch but also costs stamina.

Power affects damage delt by punches but also costs stamina.

After every round both fighters will recover some stamina and health
depending on their attributes.

If a fighter has his health reach 0/100 before the end of the round,
the game will end and the result would be a K.O. for that fighter.

If a fighter has his stamina reach 0/100 before the end of the round;
the game will end and the result would be a T.K.O. for that fighter.
